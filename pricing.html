"Danny's work formed the basis for Regroup's user interface and gave our site exactly the look and feel we wanted. He is an extremely talented user interface designer - 10 out of 10 - and also extremely easy to work with, receptive to feedback, and able to design in any style or format as well as come up with his own design suggestions and work independently. We were fortunate to have Danny work with us and I wouldn't hesitate to work with him again."
