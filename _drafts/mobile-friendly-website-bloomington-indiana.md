**Having a mobile friendly website is key for any modern business looking to compete.**

Your customers expect your website to be mobile friendly and so does Google.

Wondering if your website is mobile friendly? Google has a free tool to check: [https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly "https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly")

Enter your website address and look for two things.

1. **No loading issues**

   You will also see a preview of how your site looks on a mobile phone -

**Things to look out for -** 

* Does your design and content fit on the screen without being shrunk?
* Are there scroll bars on the bottom of the screen?
* Is it clear what you offer?
* Are there clear calls to action (buttons) to lead your customer in the right direction?
