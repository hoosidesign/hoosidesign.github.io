**Having a mobile friendly website is key for any modern business looking to compete.**

Your customers expect your website to be mobile friendly and so does Google.

Wondering if your website is mobile friendly? Google has a free tool to check: [https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly "https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly")

Enter your website address and look for **three** things.

**No loading issues**

**"Page is mobile-friendly" in green and "This page is easy to use on a mobile device"**

**Things to look out for -**

* Does your design and content fit on the screen without being shrunk?
* Are there scroll bars on the bottom of the screen?
* Is it clear what you offer?
